                            We start by setting out the annexe and protecting the site location, then move straight into groundworks followed by the installation of the steel-frame structure and weatherproof shell. From there, we progress through insulation, windows and doors, first-fix electrics/plumbing, internal finishes and final details - all managed by our team to keep the programme smooth and the site tidy.

                            Once your Annexe is complete, we carry out final checks and a full walkthrough with you to make sure everything is finished exactly as agreed. We’ll then officially hand over your new garden annexe, ready to enjoy.

                            At handover, you’ll receive your documentation pack, including your 10-year guarantee and all other relevant paperwork for your annexe (such as certificates, manuals, and key product information where applicable).
                            And it doesn’t end there - after completion we remain on hand to help with any questions or support you may need, so you feel looked after long after you’ve moved in.
