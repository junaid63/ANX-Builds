                    We’ve structured our payment terms to give you peace of mind throughout your build. Every payment is linked to a clear milestone, so you’re only paying when real progress is being made on site or meaningful work is being completed behind the scenes. This approach ensures you are never financially overexposed and always know exactly what’s happening next.

                            This deposit secures your build slot and allows us to begin the Certificate of Lawfulness process (where required). We produce your technical drawings, submit and manage the application, and prepare your full design and technical package so everything is ready to move smoothly into fabrication and site work.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This payment is due six weeks before your build starts. It allows us to begin fabrication of your steel frame and place orders for longer lead-time items such as doors, windows and kitchens. Ordering early helps protect your programme and ensures the right materials are on site when needed, reducing the risk of delays

                            This payment is due once your groundworks are complete. By this stage, supply and waste services will have been installed to the correct location and your ground screw foundations will be in place, ready for the structure to be installed.

                        <p>
                            This payment is due when the steel frame is erected on site and we’re ready to begin fitting out your garden annexe. At this point, the main materials for your project will have been ordered and will either be on site or scheduled for delivery in line with the build programme.

                            This payment is due when your annexe becomes watertight. The roof will be installed and doors and windows fitted, meaning the building is protected from the elements and internal works can move forward reliably.

                            This payment is due once plastering is completed. At this stage, the internal spaces are fully formed and we move into the final stages of second-fix work and finishing.

                            This payment is due once the kitchen and bathroom have both been installed. Your annexe is now fully functional and we move towards final completion and finishing details. We retain £2,000 until handover for your added reassurance.
                        </p>

                                <b>Your final £2,000</b>
                                instalment is due at completion and handover, the moment your new annexe becomes a finished home, ready to enjoy.
                            </span>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Before we reach that point, we carry out a full final check, complete any snagging, and make sure everything is working exactly as it should. We’ll then walk you through the annexe in person, show you how everything operates (heating, electrics, ventilation, appliances and any key features), and hand over all the relevant documents, manuals and warranties.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bs-p-1 disc wa-split-y wa-capitalize">
                    This is the exciting part: once handover is complete, the space is ready to be furnished and moved into. Whether it’s for a parent, a family member, or guests, you’ll be stepping into a warm, secure, fully finished garden annexe that’s been built to last - and you can start enjoying it immediately.
